Let me try to break it down step by step. The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of involuntary urine loss during activities like coughing or sneezing, but she doesn't leak at night. She undergoes a gynecological exam and a Q-tip test. I need to figure out what cystometry would show regarding her residual volume and detrusor contractions.\n\nFirst, I should recall what I know about these topics. Involuntary urine loss during activities like coughing is often related to stress urinary incontinence. Stress incontinence typically occurs because of weakened pelvic muscles or damaged tissues that can't prevent the bladder from leaking when there's increased pressure, like from coughing or sneezing.\n\nThe gynecological exam might include a pelvic exam, which could check for things like vaginal atrophy, pelvic relaxation, or other structural issues. The Q-tip test is a diagnostic tool used to assess urethral function. It involves inserting a Q-tip catheter into the urethra and measuring the pressure at the urethral meatus. The test can help determine if the urethral sphincter is functioning properly and if there's urethral resistance.\n\nNow, considering the findings from the gynecological exam and the Q-tip test, what would cystometry show? Cystometry, also known as a filling cystometry test, is used to assess the capacity of the bladder and the nature of bladder contractions. It measures how much the bladder can hold (residual volume) and the pressure generated during contractions (detrusor pressure).\n\nSince the patient has involuntary leakage during activities that increase abdominal pressure, it's likely that her bladder is not emptying completely during a cough. This suggests that her bladder capacity might be normal, but her detrusor contractions might be insufficient to completely empty the bladder, leading to residual volume. Additionally, the Q-tip test might show reduced urethral resistance, which could indicate that the urethral sphincter is weak or not functioning properly, contributing to the stress incontinence.\n\nPutting this together, the cystometry would probably show that she has a normal or slightly increased residual volume because her detrusor contractions aren't strong enough to empty the bladder completely. This residual volume would be above the normal threshold, contributing to the involuntary leakage. The detrusor contractions themselves might be normal in terms of their strength, but the issue lies in the coordination or the ability of the pelvic floor muscles to prevent the bladder from leaking during activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure.\n\nI should also consider other factors. The patient doesn't leak at night, which suggests that her bladder doesn't fill to a point where it overflows during sleep. This is typical in cases of genuine stress incontinence rather than overflow incontinence, which can occur when the bladder capacity is too low, leading to leakage even at rest.\n\nIn summary, the key findings from cystometry would indicate that the residual volume is elevated due to insufficient detrusor contractions, contributing to the stress incontinence. The detrusor contractions themselves might be normal, but the issue is the inability to completely empty the bladder, leading to residual volume and involuntary leakage during activities like coughing.\n</think>\n\nThe cystometry findings in this 61-year-old woman with a history of stress urinary incontinence would likely reveal an elevated residual volume due to insufficient detrusor contractions. This residual volume contributes to the involuntary leakage during activities like coughing. The detrusor contractions themselves are normal in strength, but the issue lies in the inability of the pelvic floor muscles to prevent bladder leakage during increased intra-abdominal pressure. The Q-tip test may show reduced urethral resistance, further supporting the diagnosis of stress incontinence. The normal absence of leakage at night suggests that her bladder capacity is adequate, ruling out overflow incontinence. Therefore, the key findings point to residual volume being the primary factor in her condition.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":25},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Fine Tuning ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Step 1 - Update System Prompt \ntrain_prompt_style = \"\"\"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. \nWrite a response that appropriately completes the request. \nBefore answering, think carefully about the question and create a step-by-step chain of thoughts to ensure a logical and accurate response.\n\n### Instruction:\nYou are a medical expert with advanced knowledge in clinical reasoning, diagnostics, and treatment planning. \nPlease answer the following medical question. \n\n### Question:\n{}\n\n### Response:\n<think>\n{}\n</think>\n{}\"\"\"\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-09-01T12:08:44.994459Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-09-01T12:08:44.994993Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-09-01T12:08:44.999609Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-09-01T12:08:44.994969Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-09-01T12:08:44.998793Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":26},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Step 2 - Download the finetuning dataset\ndataset = load_dataset(\"FreedomIntelligence/medical-o1-reasoning-SFT\",\"en\", split = \"train[0:500]\",trust_remote_code=True) # Keep only first 500 rows\ndataset\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-09-01T12:09:42.138385Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-09-01T12:09:42.139057Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-09-01T12:09:45.706602Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-09-01T12:09:42.139031Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-09-01T12:09:45.706061Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"README.md: 0.00B [00:00, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"d783f64d4ccc4deda1c6be185e85f151"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"medical_o1_sft.json:   0%|          | 0.00/58.2M [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"136bb22a9a524d6694ae984eaca59c49"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Generating train split:   0%|          | 0/19704 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"c91dbb0456d1484680ae14c5085a2e91"}},"metadata":{}},{"execution_count":27,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"Dataset({\n    features: ['Question', 'Complex_CoT', 'Response'],\n    num_rows: 500\n})"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":27},{"cell_type":"code","source":"dataset[1]","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-09-01T12:10:03.014610Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-09-01T12:10:03.015200Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-09-01T12:10:03.023011Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-09-01T12:10:03.015176Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-09-01T12:10:03.022432Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":28,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"{'Question': 'A 33-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 15 minutes after being stabbed in the chest with a screwdriver. Given her vital signs of pulse 110/min, respirations 22/min, and blood pressure 90/65 mm Hg, along with the presence of a 5-cm deep stab wound at the upper border of the 8th rib in the left midaxillary line, which anatomical structure in her chest is most likely to be injured?',\n 'Complex_CoT': \"Okay, let's figure out what's going on here. A woman comes in with a stab wound from a screwdriver. It's in her chest, upper border of the 8th rib, left side, kind of around the midaxillary line. First thought, that's pretty close to where the lung sits, right?\\n\\nLet's talk about location first. This spot is along the left side of her body. Above the 8th rib, like that, is where a lot of important stuff lives, like the bottom part of the left lung, possibly the diaphragm too, especially considering how deep the screwdriver went.\\n\\nThe wound is 5 cm deep. That sounds pretty deep. I mean, it could definitely reach down to the lung tissue or maybe the diaphragm. Given that it's midaxillary, we're in the territory where the lower lobe of the left lung hangs out. It's also possible there's some intersection with where the diaphragm begins, but the lung feels more probable somehow.\\n\\nNow, her vitals are concerning: elevated heart rate and low blood pressure. This is serious. My gut says that this kind of vital sign picture could mean something like pneumothorax or maybe hemothorax. Both can happen if the lung gets punctured, and they can make the blood pressure drop and the heart rate skyrocket since she's obviously distressed.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the most obvious culprit is the lower lobe of the left lung. The wound's depth and her condition point that way. And, yeah, this adds up with pneumothorax or maybe blood collecting in the chest—the kind of stuff that can really mess with breathing and circulation.\\n\\nAlright, with this in mind, it sure seems like the lung is the most likely thing that got hurt here. Makes sense given the situation, where the wound is, considering her symptoms, and the whole setup.\",\n 'Response': 'In this scenario, the most likely anatomical structure to be injured is the lower lobe of the left lung. The location of the stab wound—at the upper border of the 8th rib in the left midaxillary line—indicates proximity to the lower lobe of the lung. The depth of the wound (5 cm) suggests it is sufficient to reach lung tissue. Her vital signs of elevated heart rate and low blood pressure could signal complications like a pneumothorax or hemothorax, common consequences of lung trauma that would result from a penetrating injury in this area. Given these considerations, the lower lobe of the left lung is the most probable structure injured.'}"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":28},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# We need to format the dataset to fit our prompt training style \nEOS_TOKEN = tokenizer.eos_token  # Define EOS_TOKEN which the model when to stop generating text during training\nEOS_TOKEN","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-09-01T12:10:36.022787Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-09-01T12:10:36.023568Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-09-01T12:10:36.029496Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-09-01T12:10:36.023541Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-09-01T12:10:36.028732Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":29,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"'<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>'"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":29},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Define formatting prompt function\ndef formatting_prompts_func(examples):  # Takes a batch of dataset examples as input\n    inputs = examples[\"Question\"]       # Extracts the medical question from the dataset\n    cots = examples[\"Complex_CoT\"]      # Extracts the chain-of-thought reasoning (logical step-by-step explanation)\n    outputs = examples[\"Response\"]      # Extracts the final model-generated response (answer)\n    \n    texts = []  # Initializes an empty list to store the formatted prompts\n    \n    # Iterate over the dataset, formatting each question, reasoning step, and response\n    for input, cot, output in zip(inputs, cots, outputs):  \n        text = train_prompt_style.format(input, cot, output) + EOS_TOKEN  # Insert values into prompt template & append EOS token\n        texts.append(text)  # Add the formatted text to the list\n\n    return {\n        \"text\": texts,  # Return the newly formatted dataset with a \"text\" column containing structured prompts\n    }","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-09-01T12:11:09.532883Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-09-01T12:11:09.533632Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-09-01T12:11:09.538875Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-09-01T12:11:09.533605Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-09-01T12:11:09.538335Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":31},{"cell_type":"code","source":"dataset_finetune = dataset.map(formatting_prompts_func, batched = True)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-09-01T12:11:25.332483Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-09-01T12:11:25.333075Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-09-01T12:11:25.369814Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-09-01T12:11:25.333047Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-09-01T12:11:25.369108Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Map:   0%|          | 0/500 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"d1aa06bc39ff4748b375768b785386ba"}},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":32},{"cell_type":"code","source":"dataset_finetune[0]","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-09-01T12:11:55.055550Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-09-01T12:11:55.056072Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-09-01T12:11:55.062602Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-09-01T12:11:55.056048Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-09-01T12:11:55.061935Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":33,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"{'Question': 'Given the symptoms of sudden weakness in the left arm and leg, recent long-distance travel, and the presence of swollen and tender right lower leg, what specific cardiac abnormality is most likely to be found upon further evaluation that could explain these findings?',\n 'Complex_CoT': \"Okay, let's see what's going on here.

We have a 61-year-old woman who has been dealing with this annoying urinary issue for a while. She's losing urine involuntarily, especially when she coughs or sneezes. That sounds like a classic case of urinary incontinence, probably due to an overactive bladder. \n\nNow, when they do a pelvic exam, they'll likely check her bladder to see how it's functioning. The Q-tip test is often used in these situations. It's a way to check if there's any leakage in the urethra, which can happen in cases of urethral sphincter insufficiency. \n\nIf the Q-tip test shows no leakage, it suggests that the urethra isn't the issue. So, we're probably looking at an overactive bladder here. \n\nNow, thinking about what cystometry would show. Cystometry is like a video exam of the bladder. It shows how the bladder behaves under different conditions, like when you fill it up or let it empty. \n\nIn cases of an overactive bladder, we'd expect to see a small residual volume of urine in the bladder after it's emptied. This is usually around 50-100 milliliters. And, here's the kicker, the detrusor muscle might show some contraction during the filling phase. This is because the bladder is getting overfilled, leading to increased contractions to push out the urine.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the cystometry would likely show a small residual volume in the bladder and detrusor contractions during filling. This fits with what we know about an overactive bladder and how it behaves in these situations.\n</think>\nBased on the scenario described, the cystometry would most likely reveal a small residual volume of urine in the bladder and detrusor contractions during the filling phase. This is consistent with the findings from a Q-tip test showing no leakage, suggesting that the issue is more likely due to an overactive bladder rather than urethral sphincter insufficiency.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":40}]}
